Future Diabetes prediction  
	Diabetes is considered as one of the deadliest and chronic diseases which causes an increase in blood sugar.
	 Many complications occur if diabetes remains untreated and unidentified. The tedious identifying process results in visiting of a patient to a diagnostic center and consulting doctor. 
	But the rise in machine learning approaches solves this critical problem. The motive of this study is to design a model which can prognosticate the likelihood of diabetes in patients with maximum accuracy. 
	Therefore three machine learning classification algorithms namely Decision Tree.
